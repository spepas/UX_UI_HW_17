                    There is a lot to this section because I’ve accomplished a lot in a short amount of time; feel free to skip around.

                    Currently, I am a UI designer living just south of Austin, Texas in a college town called San Marcos. I have a cat who attempts to distract me from reading cheesy historical fiction and a dog that seems to regret our morning runs about half way through. In my free time, I dabble in various arts and crafts from making costumes to baking french patisserie. I’m a frequent patron of live music, podcasts, and kids’ movies. I also enjoy starting (but rarely finishing) crossword puzzles and knitting projects. On weekends, you can find me on hiking, camping, and going to the river. I’m a regular voter, active in my community, and I work hard to make the world a better place.
                    
                    <h2>My design philosophy is the camp of rational aesthetics.</h2>

                    I fully reject the false dichotomy of form versus function. To put two things so highly relative in contraposition does is, to me, a fruitless distinction. Form and function, like many relational concepts, exist in constant dialectical tension. It is the synthesis of form and function that merges concept with execution. In sum, art is the most moving when it completes the Hegelian dialectic of form and function.

                    I’ve always loved school. I love learning. I love knowing things. I love using things I know to solve problems. Above all, I love seeing things in new, interesting, unique, well reasoned, and/or nuanced ways. 
                    <br>
                    This didn’t mean that school was always easy for me; I struggled with math for most of my academic career and my trivia team is well aware that spelling is not my strong suit (still). yet, by the time I was in college, I had really hit my stride. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Texas State University with a Bachelor’s in Political Science at age 20. After working a few years in Austin, I came back to TSU to get my Master’s in Philosophy. My area of concentration was rational aesthetics, of which Schiller was a foundational thinker for me. I started teaching an introduction to ethics class at my Alma Mater by the age of 25. <br>

                    Academia was rewarding, but it had run it’s course for me. I wanted more financial security, but I wasn’t ready to go get my PhD; I joined the private workforce for a few years, but the pandemic pushed me in to a life trajectory I had been more cautiously and slowly planning out. It seemed that in a time where not many things were as certain as we had hoped they’d be, I might as well take a chance and bet on myself. I took graphic design classes, which I enjoyed greatly, and quickly gained a few commissions for logo design; however, I thought this was ultimately too limited a skill set for me to embrace in the long run. Much like my other hobbies, I wanted to be good at many things. Moreover, as someone with an analytical style of thinking, I didn’t want to embrace another false dichotomy like form versus function. From there I decided to take a UX/UI bootcamp and I’ve been doing web design ever since.

                    My favorite and longest running hobby is baking and I’ve been doing it with my mom since I was a little kid. To this day, when I see her, we usually make something together, even if it’s just something small that we both enjoy. These days our baked good are more complicated because we both love french patisserie (like macaroons and other meringues). My mom’s side of the family hails from a long line of German bakers and it’s become a way for me to connect with my heritage and cousins as well. I share this connection with my family with those closest to me by baking my friends cakes and tarts for their birthdays.
