                    There is a lot to this section because I’ve accomplished a lot in a short amount of time; feel free to skip around.

                    Currently, I am a UI designer living just south of Austin, Texas in a college town called San Marcos. I have a cat who attempts to distract me from reading cheesy historical fiction and a dog that seems to regret our morning runs about half way through. In my free time, I dabble in various arts and crafts from making costumes to baking french patisserie. I’m a frequent patron of live music, podcasts, and kids' movies. I also enjoy starting (but rarely finishing) crossword puzzles and knitting projects. On weekends, you can find me on hiking, camping, and going to the river. I’m a regular voter, active in my community, and I work hard to make the world a better place.
